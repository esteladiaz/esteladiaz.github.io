# Hi, I'm Estela Diaz

I taught myself how to code a while ago, and decided that that's what I like to do.

Everything needs code, or some kind of optimization. That's what makes developing so fun for someone like me -- I can hunker down to a singular topic, but as a self-proclaimed generalist, I'd rather not.

I've been playing with React for a while, and tried fully diving in a few weeks ago. I could've built this with static HTML and generic routing -- but this framework is too fun.

I want to get my hands dirty. Need collaborators? I'm your gal.
